# Simple-Mern-App
This a sipmle MERN app created using MERN(: MongoDb, ExpressJs, React and NodeJs), axios, HTML, CSS

This app is my first app using MERN and it's a contacts app: it's needed to create contacts and store them in a database, then to fetch contacts and show them.
We can insert, modify or delete a contact, accordingly every modification will be stored in the database in realtime.
